This game has similarities to the popular game 2048. In the game there is a number board where users try to get the highest score possible by swiping left, right, up or down to combine numbers to increase their point totals. Users can increase their score by combining 1 and 2 together to make three and numbers higher than 2 can be combined as well if they two adjacent numbers the same value. The score is incremented based on the the new number each swipe creates. If there are no possible moves to be made then the game ends and the user has to start again. This game can work in landscape and portrait mode.
